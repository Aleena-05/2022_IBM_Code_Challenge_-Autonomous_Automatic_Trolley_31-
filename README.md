### Problem statement
   To ensure contactless medication and mitigate the patient-nurse ratio imbalance, an autonomous system is required.

### Personas of the system
 An AUTONOMOUS MEDICINE DISPENSER would include a hands-free approach in which the patient has to do nothing other than approach the device and retrieve his/her medication. 
 There are real-world challenges that patients would face due to current system of supplying medication 
To overcome this situation we propose an motorised medicine dispenser thus junction are identified using the QR Code
